```
/** Creates a variant of `evo` whose transforms are checked against a supertype. Useful in generic contexts where `evo`'s `StrictKeys` can't resolve `keyof` on an open type parameter. The returned function evolves a subtype model, preserving all fields not in the transform, and returns the subtype. */

/** Immutably updates fields of a struct by applying transform functions. Wraps Effect's `Struct.evolve` with stricter key checking. */
