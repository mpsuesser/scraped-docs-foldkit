# Story

## Testing the Update Loop

`Story` calls update with the Model and Messages you provide. Commands stay as data until the test supplies their result Messages. You can test a complete state transition without a DOM, a timer, or a running Effect.

The entire test is one `story` call. Start from a Model, send a Message, resolve any Commands, and assert on the next Model.

## The API

Import the steps you need from `foldkit/story`.

- Top-level steps start the test, group reusable setup, send Messages, and inspect results: `story`, `steps`, `given`, `message`, `model`, `expectOutMessage`, and `expectNoOutMessage`.
- The `Command` namespace handles pending Commands: `resolve`, `resolveAll`, `resolveAllExact`, `expectHas`, `expectExact`, and `expectNone`.

Use named imports when the file contains only Story tests. If a file contains both Story and Scene tests, import the namespaces from `foldkit` so `Story.given` and `Scene.given` stay distinct.

API reference

A Command matcher accepts either a Definition or an instance. A Definition matches by name. An instance also checks structurally equal arguments.

Use `FetchWeather` when the test only cares that the Command was dispatched. Use `FetchWeather({ zipCode: '90210' })` when the zip code is part of the contract.

Mount lifecycle is a Scene concern

Story does not render the view, so the OnMount lifecycle is not observable from a Story test. Tests that need to acknowledge mounts use Scene's `Mount.resolve` and the related steps; see the [Scene](https://foldkit.dev/testing/scene) page.

## Your First Test

Here’s a test for the delayed reset from the [Commands](https://foldkit.dev/core/commands) page. Clicking reset starts a one-second delay. When the delay completes, the count returns to zero.

Delayed-reset Story test

Read it from top to bottom. The Model starts at 5. `ClickedResetAfterDelay()` returns `DelayReset`. The test resolves that Command with `CompletedDelayReset()`, which update handles by setting the count to 0.

## Multi-Step Flows

Keep each Command result next to the Message that caused it. `Command.resolve`, `Command.resolveAll`, and `Command.resolveAllExact` let a longer test stay chronological:

Multi-step test

The test does not run an HTTP request. It declares that `FetchWeather` succeeded, feeds the resulting Message through update, and checks the Model that the view will render.

Resolvers are a queue

Each `resolveAll` entry resolves one matching dispatch in declaration order. Three `[FetchCount, message]` entries resolve three `FetchCount` dispatches. For N identical responses, use `Array.makeBy(n, () => [Definition, message])`.

Unused resolvers can match later dispatches. A new resolver replaces any leftover resolver with the same Definition or instance shape.

Exact resolution

Use `resolveAllExact` when the resolver list is also a claim about which Commands were dispatched. It walks cascades like `resolveAll`, but every listed entry must match one dispatch within that call and no actual Command may remain unresolved. Repeated entries sharing a Definition consume repeated dispatches in declaration order. Supplied resolvers never carry forward.

Unresolved Commands

`message` throws if there are pending Commands from a previous step. Resolve all Commands before sending the next Message. `story` throws at the end if any Commands remain unresolved. Every Command your update function produces must be accounted for.

## Reusable Step Groups

Use `steps` when several stories share the same setup or Message sequence. The group preserves the Model, Message, and OutMessage constraints of every step inside it, so the update passed to `story` still rejects a group built for a different program.

Reusable Story steps

A group can contain any step accepted by `story`, including `given`, `message`, Model assertions, Command steps, OutMessage assertions, and another `steps` group. `story` runs the group in declaration order at the position where it appears.

Do not use Effect's `flow` to group Story steps. Message and OutMessage steps are typed data, not functions, and `steps` is the boundary that preserves their types. This does not replace `flow` for ordinary function composition elsewhere in an application.

## Testing Side Effects

Story tests the state machine. It does not run the Effect inside a Command.

To test that a Command’s Effect works correctly (for example, that an HTTP request parses the response right), test it separately with `Effect.provide` and a mock service layer:

Command Effect test

The two tests cover different contracts. Story checks which Command update returns and what update does with its result Message. The Effect test checks the work the Command executes.
