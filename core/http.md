# Http

## Overview

The `Http` module has one export: `Http.layer`, a Fetch-backed Effect `HttpClient` Layer with trace-header propagation disabled by default. Provide it to an HTTP [Command](https://foldkit.dev/core/commands), then yield `HttpClient.HttpClient` inside that Command.

Import client modules from `effect/http`, their path in Effect 4 stable.

## Why Propagation Is Off

Effect records an `http.client` span for each request. Its standard Fetch client also propagates the span context through `traceparent` and `b3` request headers. That default suits a server calling downstream services that participate in the same distributed trace.

In a browser, those extra headers can turn an otherwise CORS-simple cross-origin request into a preflighted request. `Http.layer` disables propagation so tracing alone does not change the request's CORS behavior.

Local observability remains intact. The `http.client` span still records request method, URL, and status, and a Foldkit app nests it under the Command span. Only the outgoing trace-context headers are removed.

## Providing It in a Command

Provide `Http.layer` at the edge of the Command's Effect with `Effect.provide`. The Layer is a thin wrapper around the browser's `fetch`, so it can stay local to a self-contained Command. When many HTTP Commands share one configured client, provide it once through [Resources](https://foldkit.dev/core/resources).

The Command remains responsible for status checks, response decoding, and converting failures into declared Messages.

## Customizing the Client

`Http.layer` supplies an overridable default to `FetchHttpClient.layer`, so Effect's normal client customization remains available. Provide `FetchHttpClient.Fetch` to substitute a custom `fetch` implementation. Set `HttpClient.TracerPropagationEnabled` to `true` for a Command that participates in distributed tracing.

Transform a yielded client with helpers such as `HttpClient.mapRequest` to add authentication headers or prepend a base URL. Use `HttpClient.retry` or `HttpClient.retryTransient` for request retry policies. A custom Layer is only necessary when the transport is not `fetch` or when the application wants to centralize a configured client.
