## Ongoing Work with a Model-Driven Lifetime

A Subscription describes ongoing work whose lifetime comes from the Model. Each entry maps the Model to a dependency record, then maps those dependencies to a scoped `Stream<Message>`.

The first dependency value opens the Stream's initial scope. After every Model update, Foldkit compares the latest dependencies with the previous value. Equivalent dependencies keep the current Stream alive. A change closes its scope, runs any registered `Effect.acquireRelease` finalizers, and opens a fresh scope with the new dependencies.

```

                    v
               Dependencies

     +-----------------+                        |
                       v                        |
                open fresh scope                |
                       |                        |
                       +------------+-----------+
                                    v
                         active Stream<Message>
                                    |
                                    v
                                  update
```

The Subscription is attached to the Model condition, not to the external source used inside its Stream. A timer, document listener, system theme observer, or `WebSocket` supplies events during that lifetime. Those events flow back into update as Messages.

A Subscription may also maintain scoped DOM state without emitting Messages. For example: it can apply `user-select: none` while a drag is active, then restore the previous value when dragging ends. The production [documentDragStyles](https://github.com/foldkit/foldkit/blob/477db0e12f9599e80e6c9970366281963acd1fd2/packages/ui/src/dragAndDrop/index.ts#L663-L689) Subscription uses this shape.

Choose the lifecycle primitive by what owns the work:

| Primitive | Lifetime owner | Use it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Subscription | A dependency record derived from the Model | Ongoing event streams or scoped work that does not expose a handle |
| [Mount](https://foldkit.dev/core/mount) | One rendered element | Listeners, observers, or imperative work that needs that element |
| [ManagedResource](https://foldkit.dev/core/managed-resources) | A Model condition, with a typed handle for Commands | A `WebSocket`, camera stream, or third-party instance that other parts of the program consume |

When work must be synchronous with an event, it has to run inside the listener callback. Calling `preventDefault()` is the common case: routing the event through update or a downstream `Stream` operator arrives after the browser has committed the default action. The `Subscription.fromEvent` helpers run their mappers inside the dispatch, and `Subscription.fromEventFilterMapPreventDefault` calls `preventDefault()` for every event its mapper handles.

## Auto-Counter Example

Commands describe one-shot work that produces one result. Subscriptions describe ongoing work. In the counter, a Subscription emits `Ticked` once per second while `isAutoCounting` is `true` and stops when it becomes `false`.

```
import { Duration, Effect, Schema, Stream } from 'effect'
import { Subscription } from 'foldkit'
import { defineMessageUnion } from 'foldkit/message'

// MESSAGE

const Message = defineMessageUnion({
  ClickedIncrement: {},
  ToggledAutoCounting: {},
  Ticked: {},
})
type Message = typeof Message.Type

// MODEL

const Model = Schema.Struct({
  count: Schema.Number,
  isAutoCounting: Schema.Boolean,
})
type Model = typeof Model.Type

// SUBSCRIPTION

const subscriptions = Subscription.make<Model, Message>()(entry => ({
  tick: entry(
    { isAutoCounting: Schema.Boolean },
    {
      modelToDependencies: model => ({
        isAutoCounting: model.isAutoCounting,
      }),
      dependenciesToStream: ({ isAutoCounting }) =>
        Stream.when(
          Stream.tick(Duration.seconds(1)).pipe(Stream.map(Message.Ticked)),
          Effect.sync(() => isAutoCounting),
        ),
    },
  ),
}))
```

`Subscription.make<Model, Message>()` receives a function that builds a named record of entries. Each call to `entry` takes two arguments:

- A field map defining the dependency Schema, in the same shape passed to `Schema.Struct`.
- An object containing `modelToDependencies` and `dependenciesToStream`.

`modelToDependencies` extracts the values that control the entry. `dependenciesToStream` creates its Stream. Foldkit compares the extracted record structurally by default, so unrelated Model updates do not restart the timer.

When `isAutoCounting` changes to `true`, the new Stream starts ticking. When it changes back to `false`, the active scope closes and the timer stops.

Defining `subscriptions` is only half of the setup. Pass the record to `makeApplication` or no streams start. The field is optional, so omitting it still produces a valid application without Subscription behavior.

```
import { Runtime } from 'foldkit'

import { Model, init, subscriptions, update, view } from './main'

const application = Runtime.makeApplication({
  Model,
  init,
  update,
  view,
  subscriptions,
  container: document.getElementById('root'),
})

Runtime.run(application)
```

The [websocket-chat example](https://foldkit.dev/example-apps/websocket-chat) shows a more involved event stream. [Typing Terminal](https://typingterminal.com/) and its [source](https://github.com/foldkit/foldkit/tree/main/packages/typing-game) show Subscriptions inside a complete application.

## Animation Frames

`Subscription.animationFrame` is a ready-made entry for work tied to the browser's paint clock. It emits a Message on each `requestAnimationFrame` tick while its `isActive` function returns `true`, and supplies the inter-frame delta in milliseconds.

The helper returns a complete entry with `{ isActive: boolean }` dependencies. Place it directly in the record passed to `Subscription.make`:

```
import { Schema } from 'effect'
import { Subscription } from 'foldkit'
import { defineMessageUnion } from 'foldkit/message'

// MESSAGE

const Message = defineMessageUnion({
  TickedFrame: { deltaTime: Schema.Number },
  ClickedTogglePlay: {},
})
type Message = typeof Message.Type

// MODEL

const Model = Schema.Struct({
  isPlaying: Schema.Boolean,
  angle: Schema.Number,
})
type Model = typeof Model.Type

// SUBSCRIPTION

const subscriptions = Subscription.make<Model, Message>()(_entry => ({
  frame: Subscription.animationFrame({
    isActive: model => model.isPlaying,
    toMessage: deltaTime => Message.TickedFrame({ deltaTime }),
  }),
}))
```

Use the delta to make motion independent of refresh rate. Convert the milliseconds to seconds before multiplying a per-second velocity, so the simulation behaves consistently at 60Hz, 120Hz, and after a background tab regains focus.

Use `Stream.tick` for discrete wall-clock steps that should occur every N milliseconds. `Subscription.animationFrame` follows the display; `Stream.tick` follows elapsed time. The [canvas-art example](https://foldkit.dev/example-apps/canvas-art) uses animation frames for per-frame physics, while the [snake example](https://foldkit.dev/example-apps/snake) uses `Stream.tick` for game cadence.

## DOM Events

`Subscription.fromEvent` handles DOM events that are not tied to one element in the rendered tree, such as window shortcuts, media-query changes, or document visibility. It registers the listener when the Stream scope opens and removes it when the scope closes.

The helper returns a Stream, not a complete entry. Wrap it in `Stream.when` inside an entry to gate it on the Model, or pass it to `Subscription.persistent` for a listener that lives with the whole Subscriptions record.

```
import { Effect, Schema, Stream } from 'effect'
import { Subscription } from 'foldkit'
import { defineMessageUnion } from 'foldkit/message'

// MESSAGE

const Message = defineMessageUnion({
  PressedKey: { key: Schema.String },
})
type Message = typeof Message.Type

// MODEL

const Model = Schema.Struct({
  isListening: Schema.Boolean,
})
type Model = typeof Model.Type

// SUBSCRIPTION

const subscriptions = Subscription.make<Model, Message>()(entry => ({
  shortcut: entry(
    { isListening: Schema.Boolean },
    {
      modelToDependencies: model => ({ isListening: model.isListening }),
      dependenciesToStream: ({ isListening }) =>
        Stream.when(
          Subscription.fromEvent({
            target: window,
            type: 'keydown',
            toMessage: event => Message.PressedKey({ key: event.key }),
          }),
          Effect.sync(() => isListening),
        ),
    },
  ),
}))
```

The `toMessage` mapper runs synchronously in the same call stack as the browser event, so it may call `event.preventDefault()` unless the listener is passive. Some browsers default wheel and touch listeners on global targets to passive, where cancellation is ignored. Pass `options: { passive: false }` when cancelling those events. Pass `target` as a thunk if it may not exist until the scope opens; pass always-present globals such as `window` and `document` directly.

The target, the event name, and the event your mapper receives are one fact rather than three. `type` is constrained to the events the target declares, so a misspelled name is a compile error rather than a listener that never fires, and `event` follows from both: `window` plus `'keydown'` gives you a `KeyboardEvent` with no type argument to write. A target with no declared event map, such as a bare `EventTarget`, accepts any name and reports `Event`. Annotate one with `Subscription.TypedEventTarget` to have its own events resolved the same way, `CustomEvent` detail included:

```ts
const slowWarningTarget: Subscription.TypedEventTarget<{
  'foldkit:slow-warning': CustomEvent<SlowWarningReport>
}> = new EventTarget()
```

Annotating a native target adds its declared events without losing the native ones. If a declared event uses the same name as a native event, the declared type takes precedence.

When only some events should become Messages, use `Subscription.fromEventFilterMap`. Its `toMessage` returns `Option.some(message)` to emit a Message or `Option.none()` to ignore the event. A mapper that never emits produces a `Stream<never>`, which still composes wherever a Message-producing Stream is expected.

When a handled event should also cancel its default action, use `Subscription.fromEventFilterMapPreventDefault`. Its mapper returns `Option.some(message)` to handle the event or `Option.none()` to leave its default behavior intact. The helper evaluates the mapper, calls `preventDefault()`, and queues the Message before the native listener returns. It registers the listener with `passive: false` by default and does not accept `passive: true`, which would make cancellation ineffective.

For a listener attached to one rendered element, use [Mount](https://foldkit.dev/core/mount) instead.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

`Subscription.keyboardShortcuts` builds a global `keydown` Stream from a declarative binding table. Use a string for one press, such as `'Escape'` or `'Mod+K'`, and an array for an ordered sequence, such as `['G', 'H']`. Every step in a sequence uses the same grammar, including modifiers.

```
import { Schema } from 'effect'
import { Subscription } from 'foldkit'
import { defineMessageUnion } from 'foldkit/message'
import { defineTaggedUnion } from 'foldkit/schema'

const SearchState = defineTaggedUnion({
  Closed: {},
  Open: {},
})

const Model = Schema.Struct({
  searchState: SearchState,
})
type Model = typeof Model.Type

const Message = defineMessageUnion({
  PressedSearchShortcut: {},
  PressedEscape: {},
  PressedHomeShortcut: {},
})
type Message = typeof Message.Type

const subscriptions = Subscription.make<Model, Message>()(entry => ({
  keyboardShortcuts: entry(
    { searchState: SearchState },
    {
      modelToDependencies: model => ({ searchState: model.searchState }),
      dependenciesToStream: ({ searchState }) =>
        Subscription.keyboardShortcuts<Message>({
          bindings: [
            {
              shortcut: 'Mod+K',
              whileTyping: 'Allow',
              toMessage: () => Message.PressedSearchShortcut(),
            },
            {
              shortcut: 'Escape',
              isEnabled: searchState._tag === 'Open',
              whileTyping: 'Allow',
              toMessage: () => Message.PressedEscape(),
            },
            {
              shortcut: ['G', 'H'],
              toMessage: () => Message.PressedHomeShortcut(),
            },
          ],
        }),
    },
  ),
}))
```

Modifier matching is exact: `'Mod+K'` does not also match Shift-Mod-K. `Mod` resolves to Meta on Apple platforms and Control elsewhere; `modKey` provides a deterministic override when needed. Matching uses the layout-aware `KeyboardEvent.key`, so include `Shift` and the resulting character for shifted punctuation. `Space` and `Plus` name keys that would otherwise be awkward in the `+` -separated syntax.

By default, a binding calls `preventDefault()` and does not fire from an `input`, `textarea`, `select`, or contenteditable composed path. `whileTyping: 'Allow'` opts in shortcuts such as Escape that must work inside an editor. Events during IME composition and held-key repeats are ignored; a one-press binding can opt into repeats with `whenRepeated: 'Allow'`. An event that an element-level handler already canceled is also ignored, so local interactions take precedence over global shortcuts.

### Sequences

Sequences may have any length and expire after one second unless `sequenceTimeout` overrides the duration. The helper rejects duplicate bindings, a one-press shortcut that is also a sequence prefix, and shared sequence prefixes with inconsistent `preventDefault` policies. A mismatched key clears the current sequence and is reconsidered as a fresh press.

### Model-Dependent Shortcuts

The helper returns a Stream. Put a fixed table in `Subscription.persistent`, or construct it from an entry's dependency record when availability follows the Model that owns the entry. Derive `isEnabled` from those dependencies, as the example does for Escape. If a parent owns a condition for a lifted child, declare the shortcut table at that parent or put shortcuts with different parent-owned lifetimes in separate child entries so `Subscription.lift` can gate them individually. If the meaning of a key depends on the Model, dispatch a factual Message such as `PressedEscape` and make the decision in update; `toMessage` should not read application state.

## Keep a Stream Alive Across Dependency Changes

The default structural comparison restarts an entry whenever any dependency changes. That is usually the right behavior. It becomes wasteful when one field controls the lifetime while another changes frequently and must remain available to a long-running callback.

Auto-scroll during drag and drop is one example. `isDragging` should start and stop the animation loop. `clientY` changes with every pointer movement, but restarting the loop for every pixel would destroy and recreate it continuously.

```
import { Effect, Equivalence, Queue, Schema, Stream } from 'effect'
import { Subscription } from 'foldkit'
import { defineMessageUnion } from 'foldkit/message'

const Message = defineMessageUnion({
  AdvancedAutoScrollFrame: {},
})
type Message = typeof Message.Type

const Model = Schema.Struct({
  isDragging: Schema.Boolean,
  clientY: Schema.Number,
})
type Model = typeof Model.Type

const subscriptions = Subscription.make<Model, Message>()(entry => ({
  autoScroll: entry(
    {
      isDragging: Schema.Boolean,
      clientY: Schema.Number,
    },
    {
      modelToDependencies: model => ({
        isDragging: model.isDragging,
        clientY: model.clientY,
      }),
      // Only restart the stream when isDragging changes.
      // Without this, every clientY change (every pixel) would tear down
      // and recreate the requestAnimationFrame loop.
      keepAliveEquivalence: Equivalence.Struct({
        isDragging: Equivalence.Boolean,
      }),
      // readDependencies returns the latest dependencies without restarting the stream.
      // The rAF loop calls readDependencies() each frame to get the current clientY.
      dependenciesToStream: ({ isDragging }, readDependencies) =>
        Stream.when(
          Stream.callback<typeof Message.AdvancedAutoScrollFrame.Type>(queue =>
            Effect.acquireRelease(
              Effect.sync(() => {
                const animationFrameIdRef = { current: 0 }
                const step = () => {
                  const { clientY } = readDependencies()
                  window.scrollBy(0, clientY > window.innerHeight - 40 ? 5 : 0)
                  Queue.offerUnsafe(queue, Message.AdvancedAutoScrollFrame())
                  animationFrameIdRef.current = requestAnimationFrame(step)
                }
                animationFrameIdRef.current = requestAnimationFrame(step)
                return animationFrameIdRef
              }),
              animationFrameIdRef =>
                Effect.sync(() =>
                  cancelAnimationFrame(animationFrameIdRef.current),
                ),
            ).pipe(Effect.flatMap(() => Effect.never)),
          ),
          Effect.sync(() => isDragging),
        ),
    },
  ),
}))
```

### Custom Equivalence

`keepAliveEquivalence` replaces the default structural comparison with an Effect `Equivalence`. In the example, `Equivalence.Struct({ isDragging: Equivalence.Boolean })` compares only `isDragging`. The Stream starts when dragging begins, stays alive while `clientY` changes, and stops when dragging ends.

### Reading Live Dependencies

The second argument to `dependenciesToStream` is `readDependencies`. It synchronously returns the latest dependency record, including fields that `keepAliveEquivalence` excluded from the restart decision. The animation callback can therefore read the newest `clientY` on every frame without restarting its Stream.

Most entries should use the first `dependencies` argument directly. Reach for `readDependencies` only when a long-lived callback needs current values that should not control its lifetime. The [Drag and Drop](https://foldkit.dev/ui/drag-and-drop) component and [Kanban example](https://foldkit.dev/example-apps/kanban) show this pattern in context.

## Lifting Subscriptions

When a parent embeds a Submodel with Subscriptions, the parent must lift the child's Messages into its own Message type. `Subscription.lift` composes the entire record in one call.

The optional `when` field lets the parent add a condition the child cannot see, such as whether the child's page is the active route. One predicate can gate the whole record, or a map can gate selected entries. The child continues to own its own dependencies. See [Subscription Organization](https://foldkit.dev/patterns/subscription-organization) for the complete composition pattern.

The application now has state transitions, one-shot Commands, element-scoped Mounts, and ongoing Subscriptions. The remaining question is where the first Model and startup Commands come from. [Init & Flags](https://foldkit.dev/core/init-and-flags) defines that boundary.
