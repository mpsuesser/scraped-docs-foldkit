## Overview

A thin wrapper around the native button element that provides consistent accessibility attributes and data-attribute hooks for styling. Button is a stateless render helper: call it directly with a ViewConfig in your own view. No Model, Messages, update, or `h.submodel` wrapping.

See it in an app

Check out how Button is wired up in a [real Foldkit app](https://github.com/foldkit/foldkit/blob/main/examples/ui-showcase/src/ui/view/button.ts).

## Examples

### Basic

Pass an `onClick` Message and a `toView` callback that spreads the provided attributes onto a `<button>` element.

Clicked 0 times

Basic button

### Disabled

Set `isDisabled: true` to disable the button. Foldkit uses `aria-disabled` instead of the native `disabled` attribute so the button remains focusable for screen readers.

## Styling

Button is headless. It provides no default styles. Your `toView` callback receives attribute groups to spread onto the element, and you control all markup and styling.

Use the following data attributes to style different states:

| Attribute | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| `data-disabled` | Present when `isDisabled` is true. |

## Keyboard Interaction

Button uses the native `<button>` element, so keyboard interaction is handled by the browser.

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Enter` | Activates the button. |
| `Space` | Activates the button. |

## Accessibility

Button sets `aria-disabled="true"` when disabled instead of the native `disabled` attribute. This ensures the button remains in the tab order and is announced by screen readers, while preventing click handlers from firing.

`tabindex="0"` is always set to ensure focusability. The `type` attribute defaults to `"button"` to prevent accidental form submissions.

Add your own attributes after the `button` bundle. A later attribute wins, so `h.Type('submit')` after the bundle replaces the default. A button that changes its own text, such as one cycling through values on a tap, announces each change by carrying a live region: spread `h.AriaLive('polite')` and `h.AriaAtomic(true)` after the bundle. Button does not add `aria-live` or `aria-atomic` for you.

Button with a live region

```typescript
h.button([...button, h.AriaLive('polite'), h.AriaAtomic(true)], [label])
```
